# RA Tutorial, Fall 2020

## Schedule

### Week 1: Review of R basics

**Readings**
- *R for Data Science*, Sections 1-4

**Tasks**
- Make sure you have the latest versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed
- Complete *R Programming* course in [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)

### Week 2: Data wrangling & exploration with the tidyverse, part I

**Readings**
- *R for Data Science*, Sections 5-8

**Tasks**
- Complete *Getting & Cleaning Data* course in [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
- Develop a list of questions about your dataset (e.g. *R4DS*, Section 7)
- Write an R script which loads your dataset

### Week 3: Data wrangling & exploration with the tidyverse, part II

**Readings**
- *R for Data Science*, Sections 12, 14 & 15

**Tasks**
- Write an R script which transforms your data (i.e. using `filter()`, `select()`, & `mutate()`; *R4DS*, Section 5). For this task, keep the following in mind:
  - Data should be tidy (see *R4DS*, Section 12)
  - Data should be transformed so as to answer the questions you developed last week
- In the script you create, include steps to explore and handle missing values (see *R4DS*, Section 12.5). Key questions to consider for this task are:
  - Are there missing values in your data? Are missing values represented in a consistently, or are there multiple placeholders for missing values? 
  - Can you replace missing values with `NA` in an efficient way?
  - Are there patterns of missingness that you can detect? Might these be meaningful?

### Week 4: Data visualization with ggplot2, part I

**Readings**
- *Data Visualization*, Chapters 1 & 3

**Tasks**
- Complete *Exploratory Data Analysis* course in [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
- Develop a list of visualizations you would like to create to illustrate effects of interest in your dataset
- Write an R script which creates relevant summaries of your data, using the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions (i.e. *R4DS*, Section 5)
- If you have time, try creating a few basic visualizations using `ggplot2`

### Week 5: Data visualization with ggplot2, part II

### Week 6: R Markdown for reproducible reporting, part I

### Week 7: R Markdown for reproducible reporting, part II

### Week 8: Practical

### Week 9: Practical

### Week 10: Methods, TBA

### Week 11: Methods, TBA
